### What problem are you trying to solve?

The City of Austin provides a [Restaurant Inspection Score Search](http://www.austintexas.gov/health/restaurant/search.cfm) on their website but it requires a consumer to navigate to the page and then fill out criteria for each restaurant they want to research. The data is returned in a table where there can be multiple inspection results for each location as well as multiple locations for chains like Thundercloud Subs.

By creating a free browser extension for Yelp and possibly other sites that list restaurants, inspection data can be placed where many people already look up restaurants. The data would be specific to the location and could be displayed in a simple format such as letter grades or an average of the last 3 scores with more granular data accessible through a link or popup.

There would be a companion website to display insights from the dataset of all inspections, such as average inspection score, how many inspections are performed each month, etc. The site would highlight the important contribution restaurant inspections make to citizens' health and quality of life, as well as areas where the city could improve.

### Who will benefit (directly and indirectly) from your project?

Users of the browser extension and website will benefit directly by having convenient access to Health Score information, and all patrons of Austin restaurants may benefit from the extra scrutiny placed on restaurants based on inspection scores. The city will potentially benefit by having a way to track the most popular restaurants that currently haven't been inspected or other salient data points as well as from public awareness of the services they provide.

### What other resources/tools are currently serving the same need? How does your project set itself apart?

Please see the first two paragraphs about why this is an improvement on the existing tool.

Yelp includes Health Score information

### Where can we find any research/data available/articles?

This article provides a good analysis of the issues and links to a 2005 study about how health inspection scores rose after Los Angeles implemented an analog letter grade system.

### Project management

#### Checklist for NEW ideas :baby:

Hey, you're official! You're now part of the growing civic hacking community in Austin. Here's a few things to get started (a couple you've probably already done).

- [x] Create this idea issue
- [x] Flesh out the who, where, and what questions above
- [ ] Start the conversation about this idea on [Slack](https://openaustin-slackin.herokuapp.com/) Replace this link to the [#general](https://open-austin.slack.com/messages/C036FLME2) channel with your project's preferred channel.

#### Checklist for ACTIVE projects :fire:

Let's get this project started! When this idea starts taking off, the Projects Core Team will start helping this project's lead(s) out with project management and connecting you to resources you may need. To get there, please complete and check off the following:

- [x] Post an update at least once a month to this issue. Use [BASEDEF](https://github.com/open-austin/cheatsheet-basedef) for ideas, but it's ok even if your update is just "nothing new happened this month" or "we saw a small increase in traffic to our app this month". If there's no activity for two months, that's no problem, life happens. We'll just label this as `backlog` so others know you'll get back to it when you have the time. If nobody hears from you at all in more than two months, we may mark it as `abandoned` so that others can pick up this idea and run with it.
- [ ] Take 30 minutes to complete [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101)
- [ ] Create a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new). Ask for help setting up permissions if you want your repository to be within the [Open Austin Github organization](https://github.com/open-austin).
- [ ] Create a [README file](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) in your project repository. This file should help newcomers understand what your project is, why it's important, and kinds of help you're looking for.
- [ ] [Create issues](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/project-set-up-for-collaboration-with-github/#assignment--add-your-first-issue) to describe each task that you plan to do or need help with and how a contributor can get started on that task. You might start and stop a lot, so consider issues as your to-do list.
- [ ] Create a [team](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team/) for your core contributors
  - This will make it easier for you to manage your github repo access. People on a team have the same level of access. Admin access will allow your trusted contributors to make changes as needed.
  - You can remove and add people to your team as needed.
  - View some of our teams: [https://github.com/orgs/open-austin/teams](https://github.com/orgs/open-austin/teams)
  - Note: You can also allow collaborators outside of your team and give them more limited access.
- [ ] Create a [user group](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/212906697-User-Groups) in Slack so you can "@" your core contributors all at once, without bothering other people who use the Slack channel. You'll need permission from a Slack admin, so just mention @leadership on Slack to get this set up.
- [ ] Create a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or other cloud storage to share larger files. Github and Data.World are good for code and data, respectively, especially when you need version control. But they're not good for very large files, documentation, articles, etc. A cloud storage option will allow you to easily share, create, and collaborate on documents with your team and help organize ideas and thoughts.
  - Doing this early on can help your team stay organized and to onboard new contributors who wouldn't have access to files you all have shared over email.

#### Checklist for FEATURED Projects :tada:

To have your project FEATURED on [Open-Austin.org](https://open-austin.org/), complete the following documentation. In past projects, well-documented featured projects have more contributions than other projects.

- [ ] In your README, link to the [Open Austin Code of Conduct](https://www.open-austin.org/about/#code-of-conduct) or write your own code of conduct.
- [ ] [Create file: LICENSE](http://choosealicense.com/) to give your project an open license, allowing for sharing and remixing.
- [ ] [Create file: CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/acabunoc/mozsprint-repo-template/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) so others know [how they can contribute](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).
- [ ] Create an easily shareable project management artifact, like a [Civic Tech Canvas](https://cityofaustin.github.io/civic-tech-canvas/) or [Open Canvas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/develop-an-open-project-strategy-with-open-canvas/)
- [ ] [Create an issue](https://github.com/open-austin/open-austin.github.io/issues/new) on the open-austin.github.io repo with the title `Add [my project] to projects page`. An Open Austin leader will review this issue and post your project :balloon:
- [ ] [Tell the City of Austin](http://austintexas.gov/page/mobile-app-library). If your idea is in a shareable format and can benefit people around the city, go to that site and follow the instructions on the bottom of the page to showcase your work there.

If you get stuck at any point, feel free to reach out to the leadership team on Slack by adding @leadership to your message. We're here to help you make real changes to our city.
