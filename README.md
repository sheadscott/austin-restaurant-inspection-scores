# Digestible

The purpose of this project is to make the official [Austin Public Health Food Establishment Inspection Scores](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Food-Establishment-Inspection-Scores/ecmv-9xxi) easier to digest...ü•Å

The City of Austin provides a [Restaurant Inspection Score Search](http://www.austintexas.gov/health/restaurant/search.cfm) on their website but it requires a consumer to navigate to the page and then fill out criteria for each restaurant they want to research. The data is returned in a table where there can be multiple inspection results for each location as well as multiple locations for chains like Thundercloud Subs.

By creating a free browser extension for Yelp and possibly other sites that list restaurants, inspection data can be placed where many people already look up restaurants. The data would be specific to the location and could be displayed in a simple format such as letter grades or an average of the last 3 scores with more granular data accessible through a link or popup.

A companion website will display insights from the dataset of all inspections, such as average inspection score, how many inspections are performed each month, etc. The site will highlight the important contribution restaurant inspections make to citizens' health and quality of life, as well as areas where the city could improve.
